# House Price Prediction Advanced

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques. By leveraging a dataset with 79 explanatory variables describing various aspects of residential homes, the goal is to accurately forecast the final price of each home. This involves comprehensive steps such as feature engineering, feature selection, model building, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Ames Housing dataset, which provides detailed information on various properties. It serves as an excellent alternative to the Boston Housing dataset for educational purposes.

## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bhaveshpatil093/House-Price-Prediction-Advanced.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd House-Price-Prediction-Advanced

3. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - On Windows:

   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate

   - On macOS and Linux:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   
5. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

After setting up the environment, you can explore the project through the provided Jupyter Notebooks:
- **EDA-Part-1.ipynb**: Initial exploratory data analysis.
- **Feature-Engineering.ipynb**: Processes related to feature engineering.

  To start the Jupyter Notebook server, run:

      ```bash
      jupyter notebook

  This will open a browser window where you can navigate to the desired notebook and execute the cells to see the analysis and results.
